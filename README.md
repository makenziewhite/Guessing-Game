# Guessing-Game
# For this project, we had to create a game in which the user guesses the number. The program is supposed to generate a random number. In this, the user has a certain number of guesses to guess the number that the program generated. If the user doesnâ€™t guess the correct number, the game will tell the user whether the number it generated was lower or higher than what the user guessed. If the user never guesses the correct number, the game will give them the correct answer and start a new game. If the user guesses the right number, it will congratulate the winner and the user will have the option to exit the game or to continue to another round.
