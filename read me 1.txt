       This is the code for a game that we made for an assignment in my CS 230 class, which was focused on Python. In this project, we were told to design a game that randomly shuffles words from a word list file. We also had to write prompts to help the user through the game. The object of the game is for the user to guess the scrambled word. It has an unlimited number of guesses, so one can guess as many times as they want until they get the right answer. If the user does not guess the word on the first try, more guesses are prompted until the user can guess it. Once the user guesses the word, it prompts the game to end and congratulate the player. At this point, it also shows how many guesses it took for the player to guess the word. After winning, the player has the option of exiting or playing the game again.
